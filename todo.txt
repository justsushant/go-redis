fix below type of errors in makeCommand func
(error) ERR unknown command 'sebfnk', with args beginning with: 'rkjg'


// Review of the provided code excerpt from server_test.go

1. The `Server` struct is designed to handle commands similar to those of a Redis server, interfacing with a database and outputting results.
2. The `handleCommand` method parses input, converts it to a `Command` struct, and then processes it. It supports transactional commands (`MULTI`, `EXEC`, `DISCARD`) by queuing commands until execution or discard.
3. The `takeAction` method dispatches the command to the appropriate action method based on the command name. It supports basic Redis commands like `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, `INCR`, `INCRBY`, and also `MULTI`, `EXEC`, `DISCARD`, `COMPACT`.
4. Each action method (`setAction`, `getAction`, etc.) interacts with the database (`db`) and writes the result or error message to the output (`out`).
5. The `multiAction`, `execAction`, and `discardAction` methods manage transaction states, including starting a transaction, executing queued commands, and discarding a transaction.
6. The `StringSplit` function splits the input string into command arguments, considering quoted strings as single arguments. It uses a simple state machine to handle quotes.
7. The `isValidCommand` function uses a regular expression to validate the command format before splitting.
8. The `makeCommand` method constructs a `Command` struct from the parsed arguments, validating the number of arguments for each command type and setting the transaction discard flag (`isTranDiscarded`) on argument mismatch in transaction mode.

Improvements:
- Error handling could be more consistent, especially in `makeCommand`, where errors are formatted differently.
- The transaction discard logic in `makeCommand` is repeated; this could be refactored into a separate method to reduce duplication.
- The regular expression in `isValidCommand` might not cover all valid Redis command patterns, especially for commands with more complex argument structures.
- The handling of quotes in `StringSplit` does not account for escaped quotes within quoted strings, which could lead to incorrect splitting in some cases.
